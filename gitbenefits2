Benefits of Using Git
History Tracking: Git allows you to track every change made in your project, including: who made the change and when it was made.
Collaboration: Multiple developers can be able work on the same project at the same time, and Git efficiently manages the merging of changes in code.
Branching and Merging: Git enables developers to create branches to work on new features or bug fixes and later merge them back into the main codebase.
Offline Work: Git works offline, which means you can commit changes and work on your project even without an internet connection.
